MineSweeper port on Nibble

![image from circuit mess](https://api.circuitmess.com/1597228978447-nibblebgcover.png)

This project is an attempt to port MineSweeper on [Makerbuino](https://circuitmess.com/resources/guides/en/makerbuino-build-guide/adventure-begins-320) to [Nibble](https://circuitmess.com/nibble/)

To Code:
Use Visual Studio Code with Platform IO

Guide https://circuitmess.com/resources/guides/en/platformio-nibble

To Run:
For now you have to download [CircuitBlocks](https://circuitmess.com/circuitblocks/) and create a Nibble code project to run and deploy your code to Nibble.

Platform IO will not build and deploy because of some errors in the `Sprite.cpp` lib.
